Box sorting system (Production line)
The folder contains an image of the circuit, a vidoe of the proteus simulation, proteus project file and an arduino .ino file. (ino files need to get compiled to get the hex file that gets inputed into the simulation) and a pdf file to explaing the algorithm.
I added the files needed to use the IR sensors in Proteus.
